* NNotes handbook

  In 2013, we set out to let people learn, share and earn money for doing it
  whatever they do, whoever they are, thanks to a great web plateform.

  We know already that we need first to create a place that was designed to foster
  that greatness. A place where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to
  put their best work into the hands of millions of people, with very little in
  their way.

  This book is an abbreviated encapsulation of our guiding principles. As NNotes
  continues to grow, we hope that these principles will serve each new person
  joining our ranks.  If you are new to NNotes, welcome.

  Although the goals in this book are important, it’s really your ideas, talent,
  and energy that will keep NNotes shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being
  here. Let’s make great things.



** NNotes facts

   As of february 2015, NNotes is working with IT-Translation for a potential
   investement.  It means that, if NNotes finds any relevant applications it might
   grow way beyond its current state.  Thanks to the Ensimag providing at the same
   time authors, learners and talented people we hope to make it happen.  If you
   read this, it means that you can make a difference, please keep on.



** Welcome to flatland

   As you may have already noticed, this file is largely inpired by the Valve
   handbook. Partly because of scarce resources, partly because we are taking the
   same path when it comes to management.

   Like them we think that intelligent, innovative, talented people, siting at a
   desk and doing what they’re told obliterates 99 percent of their value.

   Like them we want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where
   they’ll flourish.

   That's why once you're part of NNotes, this company is yours to steer—toward
   opportunities and away from risks. You have the power to green-light
   projects. You have the power to ship products.

   There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what authors and
   learners want, and then giving it to them.

   If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,”
   you’re right. And that’s why hiring is the single most important thing you will
   ever do at NNotes.

   Any time you interview a potential hire, you need to ask yourself not only if
   they’re talented or collaborative but also if they’re capable of literally
   running this company, because they will be.



** What to work on?

   Since NNotes is flat, people don’t join projects because they’re told
   to. Instead, you’ll decide what to work.

   Employees vote on projects with their feet. Strong projects are ones in which
   people can see demonstrated value; they staff up easily. This means there are
   any number of internal recruiting efforts constantly under way.



*** What are the possible projects underway?

    Here are lists of stuff, like current projects, but by far the best way to find
    out is to ask people. Anyone, really.

    When you do, you’ll find out what’s going on around the company and your peers
    will also find out about you. Lots of people at NNotes want and need to know
    what you care about, what you’re good at, what you’re worried about, what you’ve
    got experience with, and so on.

    And the way to get the word out is to start telling people all of those
    things. So, while you’re getting the lay of the land by learning about projects,
    you’re also broadcasting your own status to a relevant group of people.  Got an
    idea for how Valve could change how we internally broadcast project/company
    status? Great. Do it.



*** How to decide what to work on?

    You work with us to constantly be looking around for the most valuable work you
    could be doing. At the end of a project, you may end up well outside what you
    thought was your core area of expertise.

    To decide on what to work, try to answer these questions:

    - Of all the projects currently underway, what's the most valuable thing I
      can be working on?

    - Which project will have the highest direct impact on our customers? How
      much will the work I ship benefit them?

    - Is NNotes not doing something that it should be doing?

    - What’s interesting? What’s rewarding? What leverages my individual
      strengths the most?



*** Someone told me to (or not to) work on X

    Well, the correct response to this is to keep thinking about whether or not your
    colleagues are right. Broaden the conversation.

    Hold on to your goals if you’re convinced they’re correct. Check your
    assumptions. Pull more people in. Listen. Don’t believe that anyone holds
    authority over the decision you’re trying to make. They don’t; but they probably
    have valuable experience to draw from, or information/data that you don’t
    have, or insight that’s new.

    When considering the outcome, don’t believe that anyone but you is the
    “stakeholder”. You’re it. And NNotes’ authors and learners are who you’re
    serving. Do what’s right for them.



*** How does NNotes decide what to work on?

    The same way we make other decisions: by waiting for someone to decide that it’s
    the right thing to do, and then letting them recruit other people to work on it
    with them. We believe in each other to make these decisions.

    But rather than simply trusting each other to just be smart, we also constantly
    test our own decisions. Whenever we move into unknown territory, our findings
    defy our own predictions far more often than we would like to admit. We’ve found
    it vitally important to, whenever possible, not operate by using assumptions,
    unproven theories, or folk wisdom.



** Can I be included the next time NNotes is deciding X?

   Yes. All there is to do is either:
     - Start working on it or ...

     - Start talking to all the people who you think might be working on it
       already and find out how to best be valuable.



** Do I do it right?

   Whenever we move into unknown territory, our findings defy our own
   predictions far more often than we would like to admit. We’ve found it
   vitally important to, whenever possible, not operate by using assumptions,
   unproven theories, or folk wisdom.

   So we have learned that when we take nearly any action, it’s best to do so in
   a way that we can
   - measure, predict outcomes
   - analyze results



** What if I screw up?

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Nobody has ever been fired at Valve for making a mistake. It wouldn’t make
     sense for us to operate that way. Providing the freedom to fail is an
     important trait of the company - we couldn’t expect so much of individuals if
     we also penalized people for errors. Even expensive mistakes, or ones which
     result in a very public failure, are genuinely looked at as opportunities to
     learn.

     We can always repair the mistake or make up for it.  Screwing up is a great
     way to find out that your assumpions were wrong or that your model of the
     world was a little bit off. As long as you update your model and move forward
     with a better picture, you’re doing it right.

     Look for ways to test your beliefs. Never be afraid to run an experiment or
     to collect more data. It helps to make predictions and anticipate nasty
     outcomes.

     Ask yourself “what would I expect to see if I’m right?” Ask yourself “what
     would I expect to see if I’m wrong?”  Then ask yourself “what do I see?”  If
     something totally unexpected happens, try to figure out why.

     There are still some bad ways to fail. Repeating the same mistake over and
     over is one. Not listening to customers or peers before or after a failure is
     another. Never ignore the evidence; particularly when it says you’re wrong.
   #+END_EXAMPLE


** What if we ALL screw up?

   So if every employee is autonomously making his or her own decisions, how is
   that not chaos? How does Valve make sure that the company is heading in the
   right direction? When everyone is sharing the steering wheel, it seems
   natural to fear that one of us is going to veer Valve’s car off the road.
   Over time, we have learned that our collective ability to meet challenges,
   take advantage of opportunity, and respond to threats is far greater when the
   responsibility for doing so is distributed as widely as possible. Namely, to
   every individual at the company.

   We are all stewards of our long-term relationship with our customers. They
   watch us, sometimes very publicly, make mistakes. Sometimes they get angry
   with us. But because we always have their best interests at heart, there’s
   faith that we’re going to make things better, and that if we’ve screwed up
   today, it wasn’t because we were trying to take advantage of anyone.



** How Am I doing?

   Be the first to evaluate/improve yourself, as honestly as possible.  Then,
   we'll discuss a way to generalize this evaluation to make it a peers reviews.

   We can already say what are the 4 criteria:
     1. Skill Level/Technical Ability
     2. Productivity/Output
     3. Group Contribution
     4. Product Contribution



*** Skill Level/Technical Ability

    How difficult and valuable are the kinds of problems you solve? How
    important/critical of a problem can you be given? Are you uniquely capable
    (in the company? industry?) of solving a certain class of problem,
    delivering a certain type of art asset, contributing to design, writing, or
    music, etc.?



*** Productivity/Output

    How much shippable (not necessarily shipped to outside customers), valuable,
    finished work did you get done? Working a lot of hours is generally not
    related to productivity and, after a certain point, indicates inefficiency.
    It is more valuable if you are able to maintain a sensible work/life balance
    and use your time in the office efficiently, rather than working around the
    clock.



*** Group Contribution

    How much do you contribute to studio process, hiring, integrating people
    into the team, improving workflow, amplifying your colleagues, or writing
    tools used by others? Generally, being a group contributor means that you
    are making a tradeoff versus an individual contribution. Stepping up and
    acting in a leadership role can be good for your group contribution score,
    but being a leader does not impart or guarantee a higher stack rank. It is
    just a role that people adopt from time to time.



*** Product Contribution

    How much do you contribute at a larger scope than your core skill? How much
    of your work matters to the product? How much did you influence correct
    prioritization of work or resource trade-offs by others? Are you good at
    predicting how customers are going to react to decisions we’re making?
    Things like being a good playtester or bug finder during the shipping cycle
    would fall into this category.



*** Putting more tools in your toolbox

    These words are from Valve, and hope they will be true for NNotes too:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      The most successful people at Valve are both
          1) highly skilled at a broad set of things
          2) world-class experts within a more narrow discipline.

      Because of the talent diversity here at Valve, it’s often easier to become
      stronger at things that aren’t your core skill set.
    #+END_EXAMPLE



** Your Most important Role

   These words directly from Valve:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     Concepts discussed in this book sound like they might work well at a tiny
     start-up, but not at a hundreds-of-people-plus- billions-in-revenue company. The
     big question is: Does all this stuff scale?

     Well, so far, yes. And we believe that if we’re careful, it will work better and
     better the larger we get. This might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a direct
     consequence of hiring great, accomplished, capable people.

     Getting this to work right is a tricky proposition, though, and depends highly
     on our continued vigilance in recruiting/hiring.  If we start adding people to
     the company who aren’t as capable as we are at operating as high-powered, self-
     directed, senior decision makers, then lots of the stuff discussed in this book
     will stop working.

     [...]

     Hiring well is the most important thing in the universe. Nothing else comes
     close. It’s more important than breath- ing. So when you’re working on
     hiring—participating in an interview loop or innovating in the general area of
     recruiting—everything else you could be doing is stupid and should be ignored!
   #+END_EXAMPLE



*** How do we choose the right people to hire?

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      In the meantime, here are some questions we always ask ourselves when
      evaluating candidates:

      - Would I want this person to be my boss?
      - Would I learn a significant amount from him or her?
      - What if this person went to work for our competition?

      Across the board, we value highly collaborative people.  That means people
      who are skilled in all the things that are integral to high-bandwidth
      collaboration—people who can deconstruct problems on the fly, and talk to
      others as they do so, simultaneously being inventive, iterative, creative,
      talkative, and reactive.

      These things actually matter far more than deep domain-specific knowledge or
      highly developed skills in narrow areas. This is why we’ll often pass on
      candi- dates who, narrowly defined, are the “best” at their chosen
      discipline.

      Of course it’s not quite enough to say that a candidate should collaborate
      well—we also refer to the same four metrics that we rely on when evaluating
      each other to evalu- ate potential employees (see "How Am I doing?"
      section)
    #+END_EXAMPLE



*** We value “T-shaped” people

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of
      valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their
      field within a narrow disci- pline—the vertical leg of the T).

      This recipe is important for success at Valve. We often have to pass on people
      who are very strong generalists without expertise, or vice versa. An expert
      who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep
      enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an
      individual.
    #+END_EXAMPLE



*** We’re looking for people stronger than ourselves.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      When unchecked, people have a tendency to hire others who are lower-powered than
      themselves. The questions listed above are designed to help ensure that we don’t
      start hiring people who are useful but not as powerful as we are.

      We should hire people more capable than ourselves, not less.  In some ways,
      hiring lower-powered people is a natural response to having so much work to get
      done. In these conditions, hiring someone who is at least capable seems (in the
      short term) to be smarter than not hiring anyone at all.

      But that’s actually a huge mistake. We can always bring on temporary/contract
      help to get us through tough spots, but we should never lower the hiring bar.

      The other reason people start to hire “downhill” is a political one. At most
      organizations, it’s beneficial to have an army of people doing your bidding. At
      Valve, though, it’s not. You’d damage the company and saddle yourself with a
      broken organization. Good times!
    #+END_EXAMPLE



** What happens when all this stuff doesn't work?

   Sometimes, the philosophy and methods outlined in this book don’t match
   perfectly with how things are going day to day. But we’re confident that even
   when problems persist for a while, NNotes roots them out.

   As you see it, are there areas of the company in which the ideals in this book
   are realized more fully than others? What should we do about that? Are those
   differences a good thing? What would you change? This handbook describes the
   goals we believe in.

   If you find yourself in a group or project that you feel isn’t meeting these
   goals, be an agent of change. Help bring the group around. Talk about these
   goals with the team and/or others.
