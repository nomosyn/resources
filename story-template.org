*** Definitions
   - Where I MAY reference external resources and define concepts that will be
     used in the argumentation.
       - Ex: <<FixPoint>>: x is a [[FixPoint]] of function f means that f(x) = x.
       - Ex: <<wikipedia>>: [[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal][wikipedia]]


** Init State
   - Where I MUST define the initial process designed to satisfy the
     expectation.
       - Ex:
           - To add an image, a user
               - enters the string "#image" in a textarea
               - then a popup appears near the cursor with available images and
                 an upload button.
               - He uploads an image or chooses an available image using keyword
                 or click directly the minified icon of the image.
               - "#image" has been replaced by inserted into the textarea "#image <image_name>"
               - At rendering time, "#image <image_name>" is replaced by "<img ... />".


** Problem
   - Where I MUST show why the [[Init State]] fails to satisfy [[Expectations]]
     so badly that something MUST be done.
       - Ex: There is no way for the user to specify the size of the image.  It
         makes the Idea content unusable with images.  This is un-acceptable for
         the user.


** End State
   - Where I MUST define the new process designed to satisfy the [[Expectations]].
       - Ex:
           - To add an image, a user
               - enters the string "#image" in a textarea
               - then a popup appears near the cursor with available images and
                 an upload button.
               - He uploads an image or chooses an available image using keyword
                 or click directly the minified icon of the image.
               - "#image" has been replaced by inserted into the textarea "#image <image_name> 33%"
               - At rendering time, "#image <image_name>" is replaced by "<img src="d4js234" alt="<image_name>" style="width:33%;" />".

*** Rationale
    - Where I MUST show why this [[End State]] has been chosen ...
    - ... and why it is better than any others.
