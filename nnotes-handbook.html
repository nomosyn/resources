<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> NNotes handbook</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In 2013, we set out to let people learn, share and being paid for doing it,
whatever they do, whoever they are, thanks to a great web plateform.
</p>

<p>
We know already that we need first to create a place that was designed to foster
that greatness. A place where incredibly talented individuals are empowered to
put their best work into the hands of millions of people, with very little in
their way.
</p>

<p>
This book is an abbreviated encapsulation of our guiding principles. As NNotes
continues to grow, we hope that these principles will serve each new person
joining our ranks.  If you are new to NNotes, welcome.
</p>

<p>
Although the goals in this book are important, it’s really your ideas, talent,
and energy that will make NNotes shining in the years ahead. Thanks for being
here. Let’s make great things.
</p>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> NNotes facts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
As of february 2015, NNotes is working with investors for a potential
investement.  It means that NNotes might grow way beyond its current state.
If you read this, it probably means that you can make a difference, please
keep on.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Welcome to flatland</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As you may have already noticed, this file is largely inpired by the Valve
handbook. Partly because of scarce resources, partly because we are taking
the same path when it comes to corporate spirit.
</p>

<p>
Like them we think that intelligent, innovative, talented people, siting at a
desk and doing what they’re told obliterates 99 percent of their value.
</p>

<p>
Like them we want innovators, and that means maintaining an environment where
they’ll flourish.
</p>

<p>
That's why once you're part of NNotes, this company is yours to steer—toward
opportunities and away from risks. You have the power to green-light
projects. You have the power to ship products.
</p>

<p>
There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what authors and
learners want, and then giving it to them.
</p>

<p>
If you’re thinking to yourself, “Wow, that sounds like a lot of responsibility,”
you’re right. And that’s why hiring is the single most important thing you will
ever do at NNotes.
</p>

<p>
Any time you interview a potential hire, you need to ask yourself not only if
they’re talented or collaborative but also if they’re capable of literally
running this company, because they will be.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> What to work on?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Since NNotes is flat, people don’t join projects because they’re told
to. Instead, you’ll decide what to work on.
</p>

<p>
Employees vote on projects with their feet.  Strong projects are ones in which
people can see demonstrated value; they staff up easily. This means there are
any number of internal recruiting efforts constantly under way.
</p>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> What are the possible projects underway?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
Here are lists of stuff, like current projects, but by far the best way to find
out is to ask people. Anyone, really.
</p>

<p>
When you do, you’ll find out what’s going on around the company and your
peers will also find out about you.  Lots of people at NNotes want and need
to know what you care about, what you’re good at, what you’re worried about,
what you’ve got experience with, and so on.
</p>

<p>
And the way to get the word out is to start telling people all of those
things.  So, while you’re getting the lay of the land by learning about
projects, you’re also broadcasting your own status to a relevant group of
people.  Got an idea for how NNotes could change how we internally broadcast
project/company status? Great. Do it.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> How to decide what to work on?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
You work with us to constantly be looking around for the most valuable work
you could be doing.  At the end of a project, you may end up well outside
what you thought was your core area of expertise.
</p>

<p>
To decide on what to work, try to answer these questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of all the projects currently underway, what's the most valuable thing I
can be working on?
</li>

<li>Which project will have the highest direct impact on our authors and
learners?  How much will the work I ship benefit them?
</li>

<li>Is NNotes not doing something that it should be doing?
</li>

<li>What’s interesting?  What’s rewarding?  What leverages my individual
strengths the most?
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.3</span> Someone told me to (or not to) work on X</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
Well, the correct response to this is to keep thinking about whether or not your
colleagues are right.  Broaden the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Hold on to your goals if you’re convinced they’re correct.  Check your
assumptions.  Pull more people in. Listen.  Don’t believe that anyone holds
authority over the decision you’re trying to make.  They don’t; but they
probably have valuable experience to draw from, or information/data that you
don’t have, or insight that’s new.
</p>

<p>
When considering the outcome, don’t believe that anyone but you is the
“stakeholder”.  You’re it.  And NNotes’ authors and learners are who you’re
serving.  Do what’s right for them.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.4</span> How does NNotes decide what to work on?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-4">
<p>
The same way we make other decisions: by waiting for someone to decide that it’s
the right thing to do, and then letting them recruit other people to work on it
with them.  We believe in each other to make these decisions.
</p>

<p>
But rather than simply trusting each other to just be smart, we also
constantly test our own decisions.  Whenever we move into unknown territory,
our findings defy our own predictions far more often than we would like to
admit.  We’ve found it vitally important to, whenever possible, not operate
by using assumptions, unproven theories, or folk wisdom.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Can I be included the next time NNotes is deciding X?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Yes. All there is to do is either:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start working on it or &#x2026;
</li>

<li>Start talking to all the people who you think might be working on it
already and find out how to best be valuable.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Do I do it right?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Whenever we move into unknown territory, our findings defy our own
predictions far more often than we would like to admit.  We’ve found it
vitally important to, whenever possible, not operate by using assumptions,
unproven theories, or folk wisdom.
</p>

<p>
So we have learned that when we take nearly any action, it’s best to do so in
a way that we can:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>measure, predict outcomes
</li>
<li>analyze results
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> What if I screw up?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<pre class="example">
Nobody has ever been fired at Valve for making a mistake. It wouldn’t make
sense for us to operate that way. Providing the freedom to fail is an
important trait of the company - we couldn’t expect so much of individuals if
we also penalized people for errors. Even expensive mistakes, or ones which
result in a very public failure, are genuinely looked at as opportunities to
learn.

We can always repair the mistake or make up for it.  Screwing up is a great
way to find out that your assumpions were wrong or that your model of the
world was a little bit off. As long as you update your model and move forward
with a better picture, you’re doing it right.

Look for ways to test your beliefs. Never be afraid to run an experiment or
to collect more data. It helps to make predictions and anticipate nasty
outcomes.

Ask yourself “what would I expect to see if I’m right?” Ask yourself “what
would I expect to see if I’m wrong?”  Then ask yourself “what do I see?”  If
something totally unexpected happens, try to figure out why.

There are still some bad ways to fail. Repeating the same mistake over and
over is one. Not listening to customers or peers before or after a failure is
another. Never ignore the evidence; particularly when it says you’re wrong.
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7"><span class="section-number-3">1.7</span> What if we ALL screw up?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<pre class="example">
So if every employee is autonomously making his or her own decisions, how is
that not chaos? How does Valve make sure that the company is heading in the
right direction? When everyone is sharing the steering wheel, it seems
natural to fear that one of us is going to veer Valve’s car off the road.
Over time, we have learned that our collective ability to meet challenges,
take advantage of opportunity, and respond to threats is far greater when the
responsibility for doing so is distributed as widely as possible. Namely, to
every individual at the company.

We are all stewards of our long-term relationship with our customers. They
watch us, sometimes very publicly, make mistakes. Sometimes they get angry
with us. But because we always have their best interests at heart, there’s
faith that we’re going to make things better, and that if we’ve screwed up
today, it wasn’t because we were trying to take advantage of anyone.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
Be the first to evaluate/improve yourself, as honestly as possible.  Then,
we'll discuss a way to generalize this evaluation to make it a peers reviews.
</p>

<p>
We can already say what are the 4 criteria:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Skill Level/Technical Ability
</li>
<li>Productivity/Output
</li>
<li>Group Contribution
</li>
<li>Product Contribution

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-1">
<p>
How difficult and valuable are the kinds of problems you solve?  How
important/critical of a problem can you be given?  Are you uniquely capable
(in the company? industry?) of solving a certain class of problem,
delivering a certain type of art asset, contributing to design, writing, or
music, etc.?
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-8-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-8-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.8.2</span> Productivity/Output</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-2">
<p>
How much shippable (not necessarily shipped to outside customers), valuable,
finished work did you get done? Working a lot of hours is generally not
related to productivity and, after a certain point, indicates inefficiency.
It is more valuable if you are able to maintain a sensible work/life balance
and use your time in the office efficiently, rather than working around the
clock.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-8-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-8-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.8.3</span> Group Contribution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-3">
<p>
How much do you contribute to hiring, integrating people into the team,
improving workflow, amplifying your colleagues, or writing tools used by
others? Generally, being a group contributor means that you are making a
tradeoff versus an individual contribution.  Stepping up and acting in a
leadership role can be good for your group contribution score, but being a
leader does not impart or guarantee a higher stack rank.  It is just a role
that people adopt from time to time.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-sec-1-8-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-8-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.8.4</span> Product Contribution</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-8-4">
<p>
How much do you contribute at a larger scope than your core skill?  How much
of your work matters to the product?  How much did you influence correct
prioritization of work or resource trade-offs by others?  Are you good at
predicting how authors and learners are going to react to decisions we’re
making?  Things like being a good tester or bug finder during the shipping
cycle would fall into this category.

These words are from Valve, and hope they will be true for NNotes too:
</p>

<pre class="example">
The most successful people at Valve are both
    1) highly skilled at a broad set of things
    2) world-class experts within a more narrow discipline.

Because of the talent diversity here at Valve, it’s often easier to become
stronger at things that aren’t your core skill set.

<h3 id="sec-1-9"><span class="section-number-3">1.9</span> Your Most important Role</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">
<pre class="example">
Concepts discussed in this book sound like they might work well at a tiny
start-up, but not at a hundreds-of-people-plus- billions-in-revenue company. The
big question is: Does all this stuff scale?

Well, so far, yes. And we believe that if we’re careful, it will work better and
better the larger we get. This might seem counterintuitive, but it’s a direct
consequence of hiring great, accomplished, capable people.

Getting this to work right is a tricky proposition, though, and depends highly
on our continued vigilance in recruiting/hiring.  If we start adding people to
the company who aren’t as capable as we are at operating as high-powered, self-
directed, senior decision makers, then lots of the stuff discussed in this book
will stop working.

[...]

Hiring well is the most important thing in the universe. Nothing else comes
close. It’s more important than breath- ing. So when you’re working on
hiring—participating in an interview loop or innovating in the general area of
recruiting—everything else you could be doing is stupid and should be ignored!

<h4 id="sec-1-9-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.1</span> How do we choose the right people to hire?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-1">
<pre class="example">
In the meantime, here are some questions we always ask ourselves when
evaluating candidates:

- Would I want this person to be my boss?
- Would I learn a significant amount from him or her?
- What if this person went to work for our competition?

Across the board, we value highly collaborative people.  That means people
who are skilled in all the things that are integral to high-bandwidth
collaboration—people who can deconstruct problems on the fly, and talk to
others as they do so, simultaneously being inventive, iterative, creative,
talkative, and reactive.

These things actually matter far more than deep domain-specific knowledge or
highly developed skills in narrow areas. This is why we’ll often pass on
candi- dates who, narrowly defined, are the “best” at their chosen
discipline.

Of course it’s not quite enough to say that a candidate should collaborate
well—we also refer to the same four metrics that we rely on when evaluating
each other to evalu- ate potential employees (see "How Am I doing?"
section)

That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of
valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their
field within a narrow disci- pline—the vertical leg of the T).

This recipe is important for success at Valve. We often have to pass on people
who are very strong generalists without expertise, or vice versa. An expert
who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep
enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an
individual.

When unchecked, people have a tendency to hire others who are lower-powered than
themselves. The questions listed above are designed to help ensure that we don’t
start hiring people who are useful but not as powerful as we are.

We should hire people more capable than ourselves, not less.  In some ways,
hiring lower-powered people is a natural response to having so much work to get
done. In these conditions, hiring someone who is at least capable seems (in the
short term) to be smarter than not hiring anyone at all.

But that’s actually a huge mistake. We can always bring on temporary/contract
help to get us through tough spots, but we should never lower the hiring bar.

The other reason people start to hire “downhill” is a political one. At most
organizations, it’s beneficial to have an army of people doing your bidding. At
Valve, though, it’s not. You’d damage the company and saddle yourself with a
broken organization. Good times!

Sometimes, the philosophy and methods outlined in this book don’t match
perfectly with how things are going day to day. But we’re confident that even
when problems persist for a while, NNotes roots them out.

As you see it, are there areas of the company in which the ideals in this
book are realized more fully than others?  What should we do about that? Are
those differences a good thing? What would you change?  This handbook
describes the goals we believe in.
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself in a group or project that you feel isn’t meeting these
goals, be an agent of change.  Help bring the group around.  Talk about these
goals with the team and/or others.
